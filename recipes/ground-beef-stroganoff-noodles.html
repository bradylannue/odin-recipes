            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>

                <li>Melt butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. 
                    Add mushrooms, season with salt, and saute, stirring occasionally, 
                    until they turn golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>

                <li>Add onion and ground beef. 
                    Cook, stirring, until meat is browned and crumbly, 
                    and onions turn soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. 
                    Season with black pepper and cayenne.</li>

                <li>Stir in minced garlic and flour, and cook for 1 minute.</li>

                <li>Pour in vodka and allow to evaporate, about 30 seconds.</li>

                <li>Stir in beef broth and water and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, 
                    for 10 minutes.</li>

                <li>Reduce heat to medium, and mix in noodles. 
                    Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 5 minutes. 
                    Uncover and stir thoroughly. Cover again and cook until 
                    noodles are just tender, about 3 minutes. (See Cook's Note.)</li>

                <li>Once noodles are cooked, reduce heat to low, and stir in sour cream.</li>

                <li>Serve immediately with additional sour cream and green onions or chives if so desired.</li>
                
            </ol>
